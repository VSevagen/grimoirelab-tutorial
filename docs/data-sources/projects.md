# What is projects.json ?

The projects.json allows users to group repositories into one project which will be displayed on the dashboard.

Users can list out the instances of the software development tools to be analyse, such as local and reote Git repositories, the URLs of GitHub and GitLab issue trackers and the name of Slack channels. Users can also group those instances into one structure which can be represented as one entity in the dashboard. It is useful when representing projects within communities or companies.

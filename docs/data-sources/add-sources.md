# How to add data sources

In order to add data sources, you need to do some changes in both <code>projects.json</code> and <code>setup.cfg</code>

However, depending on the data source, the changes to ported might differ. Refer to the [supported data sources](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-sirmordred#supported-data-sources-) section to find the exact lines to be added according to your data source.

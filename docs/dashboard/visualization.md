# Choosing a visualization type

A visualization, as the name suggests, is the representation of your data in the form of a
diagram of some sort (pie-chart, data table, heat map etc...)

In order to start creating your visualization, you need to decide on a visualization type.
Usually the choice of a visualization type is an obvious choice since the user will have
an idea of what it should look like.

### Steps
1. Navigate to the `Visualize` dashboard. You can do so by clicking on the `Visualize`
   icon in the sidebar. It's the second icon from the top.
2. Once you have the above open, click on the `+` icon to open up the visualization types
   panel.

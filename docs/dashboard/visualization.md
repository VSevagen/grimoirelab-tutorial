# Choosing a visualization type ?

A visualization, as the name suggests, is the representation of your data in the form of a
diagram of some sort (pie-chart, data table, heat map etc...)

In order to start creating your visualization, you need to decide on a visualization type.
Usually the choice of a visualization type is an obvious choice since the user will have
an idea of what it should look like.

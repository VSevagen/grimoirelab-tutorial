# How to create a new dashboard

Creating a dashboard is pretty intuitive in GrimoireLab.

The first step is to open the dashboards interface which lists out all the created
dashboards. Click on the `Dashboard` icon in the sidebar. It is the third one form the
top.

To create a new dashboard, click on the button labelled `Create new dashboard`. You can
check out the existing dashboards below to get an idea of what kind of dashboard you need.

Once you've clicked the `Create new dashboard` button, you'll be presented with an empty
dashboard which you can fill with the visualizations of your choice. Click on the `Add`
button to open the visualization sidepanel and click of the needed visualizations to add
them to your dashboard.

Once you've added your required visualization, you can save the dashboard by pressing the `Save` button. It is the third one on the left from the `Add` button. Make sure you're logged in before saving the dashboard.

# Who has access to the dashboard

There are two main roles concerning dashboard access, 
- The user with permission to see the dashboard
- The user with permission to edit the dasboard and accessing indexes.

Lets take the example of [CHAOSS Community dashboard](http://chaoss.biterg.io). Anyone can
access their grimoirelab dashboard and view the information as it is publicly available.
However, the CHAOSS Community dashboard has a login button where only people with proper
permission can login to perform actions such as creating, editing and removing dashboards.

# Getting started

GrimoireLab is a set of tools, and to ease the trouble with installation we are providing a default setup to analyze Git activity for the grimoirelab repository. In order to have this default setup running, follow the [setup grimoirelab](https://vsevagen.github.io/grimoirelab-tutorial/docs/getting-started/setup/) section.

In case you want to configure grimoirelab to include your own data source, refer to [How to add a data source](https://vsevagen.github.io/grimoirelab-tutorial/docs/data-sources/add-sources/)

# Configure GrimoireLab

GrimoireLab can be configured through two files:

- projects.json
- setup.cfg

You can visit [projects.json](https://vsevagen.github.io/grimoirelab-tutorial/docs/data-sources/projects/) and [setup.cfg](https://vsevagen.github.io/grimoirelab-tutorial/docs/data-sources/setup/) for more details on what their role is in the GrimoireLab environment.

In the case you want to add more data sources to your dashboard, you can refers to the [add data sources](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-sirmordred#supported-data-sources-) section.

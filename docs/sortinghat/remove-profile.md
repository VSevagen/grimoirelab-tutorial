# How to remove a profile

Every profile in the <code>Individuals</code> table will have a "More options" icon which opens up a dropdown with several options, including <strong>Delete profile</strong>. Clicking on "Delete profile" will open a pop-up where you'll have to confirm that you really want to delete this profile. If yes, press <strong>Confirm</strong>. This will remove the said individual from SortingHat.<br>

In the case several profiles need to be removed, they can be selected and deleted in batches using the "Delete" button. To select a profile, click on the profile once. A dark blue strip will appear on the left side of the profile tab. That is the indicator that a profile is selected.

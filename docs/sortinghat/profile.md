# Difference between profiles and identities

Each individual will have a unique profile which may or may not consists of several identities. A profile is unique to one particular individual, that is no-one will have the same profile with the same information (Name, Email, Username, Affiliations etc... )

For example, you can think of <strong>profiles as human beings</strong>. Every human being is different, hence unique. If that person goes to the bank and creates an account, he'll be given an account card. That is one of his identities, a customer of the bank.

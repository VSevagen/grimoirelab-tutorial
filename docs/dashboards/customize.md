## How to change the color of visualizations

Some visualizations make use of graphs, charts and tables to represent data. In order to
represent the different data, several contrasting colors are used.

- Steps
  1. Find the panel in which you want to change the color.
  2. Every panel that makes use of colors will have the sample color and the data it
     represents on the right side of the panel. In the case it is not visible, click on
     the arrow key on the right side of the panel.

# Dashboards

A dashboard is used to monitor, evaluate and analyze the state of one or more aspects of
your project or community. GrimoireLab allows you to have as many dashboards as needed and
offers an easy way to navigate through them.

In this section, we'll be talking about how to use the dashboards and interact with the
features available.

# Who has access to the dashboards

There are two main roles concerning dashboards access, 
- The user with permission to see the dashboards
- The user with permission to edit the dasboards and accessing indexes.

Lets take the example of [CHAOSS Community dashboards](http://chaoss.biterg.io). Anyone can
access their GrimoireLab dashboards and view the information as it is publicly available.
However, the CHAOSS Community dashboards has a login button where only people with proper
permission can login to perform actions such as creating, editing and removing dashboards.

# How to filter data

There are two places in GrimoireLab where we can change and add filters.

- Time Picker
- Normal Filters

### Time Picker

Most dashboards are based on item creation date. So you can filter according to a time
frame. Time Picker allows you to visualize data according to a particular time frame.

You can also set a custom time picker if needed. Go to the section `Time picker quick
ranges` in `Management` -> `Advances Settings` and add your quickRanges to the list. An
example of quickRange is provided below. `from` and `to` contain date values, `display` is
the title thay will be displayed in kibiter and `section` defines the column where the
quickRange will be added.

**Note: You need to be logged in to save your custom time picker. Check the
[private and public access]() section to understand about permissions in GrimoireLab dashboards.**

```
{
  "from": "2020-03-21 00:00:00",
  "to": "2020-04-24 00:00:00",
  "display": "Most active period",
  "section": 3
}
```

You can also set a custom time picker without actually looking into settings. 

1. Click on Time Picker and choose "Absolute".

2. Set your time frame and press on "Go" to apply the filter.

### Normal Filters

You can set a filter by clicking on **Add filter**. This filter allows you to set a
particular key-value pair and display the visualizations according to that value. You can
even set the operators to check for that particular value orevery other data except the
one mentioned.

#### Steps

- Click on "Add filter" on top of your panels.

- Once you've set your values, save it and the visualizations should re-ajust to fit your
  filter.

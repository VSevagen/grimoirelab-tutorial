# Issues Closed
Question: How many issues were closed during a certain period?

Issues are defined as in Issues New. Issues closed are those that changed to state closed during a certain period.

In some cases or some projects, there are other states or tags that could be considered as "closed". For example, in some projects they use the state or the tag "fixed" for stating that the issue is closed, even when it needs some action for formally closing it.

In most issue trackers, closed issues can be reopened after they are closed. Reopening an issue can be considered as opening a new issue, or making void the previous close (see parameters, below).

For example, in GitHub Issues or GitLab Issues, issues closed are issues that were closed during a certain period.

### Objectives
Volume of issues that are dealt with in a project. Closed issues are a proxy for the activity in a project. By counting closed issues related to code in the set of repositories corresponding to a project, you can have an idea of the overall activity in finishing work with issues in that project. Of course, this metric is not the only one that should be used to track volume of coding activity.

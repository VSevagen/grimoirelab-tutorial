# Issues Active
Question: How many issues were active during a certain period?

Issues are defined as in Issues New. Issues showing some activity are those that had some comment, or some change in state (including closing the issue), during a certain period.

For example, in GitHub Issues, a comment, a new tag, or the action of closing an issue, is considered as a sign of activity.

### Objectives
Volume of active issues in a project. Active issues are a proxy for the activity in a project. By counting active issues related to code in the set of repositories corresponding to a project, you can have an idea of the overall activity in working with issues in that project. Of course, this metric is not the only one that should be used to track volume of coding activity.

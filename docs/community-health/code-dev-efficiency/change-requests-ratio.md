# Change Request Acceptance Ratio
Question: What is the ratio of change requests accepted to change requests closed without being merged?

Each change request can be in one of three states: open, merged (accepted), and closed without merge (declined). This metric measures the ratio of change requests merged (accepted) vs change requests closed without being merged.

### Objectives
The ratio of change requests merged to change requests closed without merging provides insight into several repository characteristics, including openness to outside contributions, growth of the contributor community, the efficiency of code review processes, and, when measured over time, the trajectory of a project in its evolution. Different ratios should be interpreted in the context of each repository or project.

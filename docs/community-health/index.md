# Understanding Community health

GrimoireLab is the platform through which community health can be monitored but what is
community health and how can we define it ?

Community health is the potential that a project can continue developing quality software.
There are different ways that it can be evaluated. For example, we can analyze the health
of a community through the code quality, the activity in the community ( are the
contributors active, are the issues being resolved, the diversity of contributors) and the
resources needed by the project.

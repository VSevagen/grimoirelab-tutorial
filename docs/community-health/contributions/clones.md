# Clones
Question: How many copies of an open source project repository have been saved on a local machine?

A clone is a copy of a repository saved to a local machine.

Note: Many times clone and technical fork are used interchangeably, but there is a difference between the two. A technical fork is a copy of a repository on the same platform, whereas a clone is a copy on a local machine.

### Objectives
